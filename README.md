Crowd founded Global Top Level Domains with Smart Contracts

## Abstract

New Global Top Level Domains are relativiely expense to buy.  Using the etheruem blockchain, we can create a smart contract to allow anyone to create and bid on new gTLDs.  https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en

## Process

1.  A "seller" adds their suffix to the smart contract and pays a 10 ETH fee.  For example, `.ico`
2.  This suffix is unique to the smart contract, and the seller is now has the ability to auction the sub domains.
3.  The seller sets the crowd fund sale paramters, similar to ICO sales

- Start Date
- Min Price
- Min ETH raised to pay ICANN fees

4.  Once the sale has reaches its target, the seller can the withdraw the ETH.

The smart contract can hold multiple sales.  One contract address can be socialsed to hold unlimited conncurrent sales.
